Game Development Ambassador Game

The game will embody the player as a medieval postman during the bubonic plague. 
The player will be commanded to deliver several packages through interactions with different NPCs. 
The deliveries will impose the player to take decisions that will cause different endings. F
rom deciding whether to deliver medicine, tools, or equipment, among other things, to the people or keeping these items so the player’s final boss fight is easier. 
The decisions of the player will have an impact on the ending of the game.
The aesthetics of the game will consist of a medieval world with fantasy. 
Several levels and scenes will be created. 
The levels will be used to take the character to different locations throughout the kingdom.
The player will have the possibility to interact with the people of the kingdom, royal members, or the working class. 
Some of the NPCs will have quests for the player which will have integrated decisions that will cause an impact in the end. 
Taking decisions towards the items the character is delivering will have the possibility to increase player statistics. 
Also, deciding whether to be good or bad to people will have consequences as well. If the player is far too good with NPCs, 
some NPCs may try to take advantage of the player’s kindness.
This is a 2D game in which the player is a medieval postman framed for murder by the king. 
The player will control the postman by making deliveries and making decisions that may make vengeance easier or harder.
